A bunch of utilities to perform boring chores

## Requirements

Most scripts are for my personal use.

Anyway some of them require these environment variables to be set:

- `CODEPATH`
- `ORGPATH`

The `$ORGPATH` points to a directory structured like this:

```
.
├── SPARKFILE.md # a file for brain dumping
├── blog # a harp blog
├── journal # just a dir
└── todo # the todo.txt dir
```
