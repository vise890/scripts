A bunch of utilities to perform boring chores

## Requirements

- `xclip`

Most scripts are for my personal use.

Anyway some of them require these environment variables to be set:

- `CODEPATH`
- `ORGPATH`

The `$ORGPATH` points to a directory structured like this:

```
.
└── todo # the todo.txt dir
```
